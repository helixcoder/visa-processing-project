# Visa Processing Time Prediction – Machine Learning Project

# Overview
This project aims to forecast the visa processing time, which takes days.

It is based on an organized workflow process that includes data processing, exploration, and training.

---
# Objective
The
For calculating the visa issuance time based on:
- Employer information
- Job details
- Salary

- Dates of receiving applications and decision

- Applicant country

Target variable:
atrice
processing_time_days = decision_date - received_date
-
## Step 1: Collection and Preprocessing of Data
- Loaded and preprocessed raw visa data
• Dealt with missing values

- Parsed Date Columns

- Created processing_time_days
- Coded categorical variables
- Saved preprocessed dataset
---
## Milestone 2 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Processing Time Distribution Analysis

- Country-wise trends
- Employer frequency analysis
- Correlation Analysis
• Insights on the importance of features
