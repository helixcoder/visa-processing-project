Visa Processing Time Prediction – Machine Learning Project

This project applies machine learning to forecast **visa processing duration in days.

It follows the entire workflow: **data collection → preprocessing → EDA → model training → evaluation**.

---
Objective:
Provide a model that predicts how many days a visa application will take using some of the following attributes:
- Information about the employer
Job details
- Wage

Date received: date; Date accepted: date (to be filled in by the Publisher)

Application country

That is how, at end, the relationship has been specified; it is the fate of men and women.
Milestone 1 – Data Collection & Preprocessing
### Steps Completed ✔
- Loaded raw visa dataset
Cleaned and handled missing values
- Parsed date columns

- Generate target variable `processing_time_days`

- Encoded categorical variables (One-hot + Frequency encoding)
- Saved processed, clean dataset
---
EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
EDA notebook includes:
- Distributions of processing time

- Heatmap of missing values

Country-wise trends
- Correlation heatmap
- Frequency analysis by employer
sticking to and maintaining a balance between unbalanced power with the appropriate use of relevant instruments.
Model Training (Milestone 2)

Algorithms used:
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest

- Gradient Boosting

-XGBoost Metrics assessed: - **MAE** - **RMSE** - **R² Score** "--- Project Structure
